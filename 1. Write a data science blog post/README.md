# Introduction

For this project I decided to analyse the bank customers' marketing data from Kaggle website. This data contains nearly 50,000 responses from May 2008 to November 2010. I have used jupyter notebook to do the analysis which can find be found in the Bank_Data_Analysis.ipynb file.

# Exploratory analysis

For this analysis, I have focused on understanding term deposit responses based on customers’ profiles:

-Customer personal details (age, sex, address etc.)
-Social Profiles (married or unmarried)
-Education levels
-Job profiles and the roles they play (are they in junior role, mid-level, senior managers, executives, type of industry etc.)
-Do the customers have their own property? And do they have active ongoing mortgages? 

Along with the following queries:
-What is the Median age of the people saying yes to Term deposit?
-What is Q3 of balance of people rejecting the product?
-What is the education qualification of most of the bank customers who -have taken loan?
